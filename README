Ok, so try:

`rake assets:precompile`.

I get:

```
rake aborted!
wrong number of arguments (2 for 1) for `font-url'
  (in /.../compass-rails-url-helpers-test/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss)

Tasks: TOP => assets:precompile:primary
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
rake aborted!
